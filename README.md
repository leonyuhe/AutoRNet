#AutoRNet: Automatically Optimizing Heuristics for Robust Network Design via LLMs

##Overview

AutoRNet is a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to automatically generate robust heuristics for network optimization. It focuses on enhancing network robustness by leveraging domain-specific knowledge and adaptive strategies. This repository includes the implementation of AutoRNet, along with example datasets and tools for evaluating network robustness.

##Key features:
	•	Integration of LLMs with EAs for automated heuristic design.
	•	Network Optimization Strategies (NOS) for domain-specific problem solving.
	•	Adaptive Fitness Function (AFF) to balance convergence and diversity during optimization.
